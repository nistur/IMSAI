# IMSAI

Attempt at an IMSAI 8080 emulator using [TLVM](https://github.com/nistur/tlvm).

Currently doesn't do any actual IMSAI specific code yet, but it is hooked up to use cpudiag from CP/M. Cpudiag hasn't been included as I'm not entirely whether I'm allowed to duplicate it here. Doing a quick search for something like `cpudiag.bin 8080` should find it.
